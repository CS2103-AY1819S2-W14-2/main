== Overview

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *image manipulation commands*
** What it does: allows the user manipulate images on a physical level, such as rotating, cropping and resizing the target image.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it is an essential feature to an image editor. Users might want to rotate their images because the position is wrong or crop out certain unwanted parts in the image. Should the image be too large, the user can resize it as well.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects the way in which the images are stored within the application. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: ImageSclr Library 

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
