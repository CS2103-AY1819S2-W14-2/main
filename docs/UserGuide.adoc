== Introduction

FomoFoto is a image processing software suite written in Java. This application is optimised for users who are *familiar with the Command Line Interface (CLI)*, while providing a *Graphical User Interface (GUI)* for easy reference. For those who love the CLI, this is written for you! If you are not familiar, don't worry, we'll take you through and you'll be a pro in no time! Who knows? You might even be editing your pictures faster than your friends who use Photoshop! Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!


== Quick Start
Follow the steps below to set up your computer to run FomoFoto.

.  Ensure you have Java version 9 or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest FomoFoto.jar here.
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your FomoFoto application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  And you have just started up FomoFoto on your device! You can refer to <<Features>> for details of each command. If you would like a step-by-step walk through of our application, scroll down to the next section: A Walk Through.


== A Walk Through
Let's start on our image editing journey. In this walk through, we will be demonstrating some simple commands to edit a sample image.

.  Head over to this https://twistedsifter.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/squirrel-photobomb-banff.jpg[`link`] to get a suggested sample image to start from.

.  Save the image in any desired folder you like on your device, like your Pictures folder for example. Name your image *squirrel.jpg*.

.  Start FomoFoto by referring to <<Quick Start>>.

.  Open the folder that the image file is stored in. Then, to get the file path of the image:
* In Windows: Hold on to the kbd:[Shift] key and *right click* on your image file. Click the option *Copy path*.
* In Mac: Go to terminal and navigate to your image file. Type 'pwd' to get the filepath to your image file and copy paste.

.  Go back to the FomoFoto application. Import the image into FomoFoto by typing as follows:
+
.Import Command
image::import.JPG[width="912"]
+
.  Paste the file path by simultaneously pressing kbd:[Ctrl] and kbd:[V] keys.
* In Windows: Remove the kbd:["] and kbd:["] signs at the two ends of the filepath.

.  Ensure your final command looks similar to the figure below (filepath may differ):
+
.Import with Filepath
image::importCommand.JPG[width="915"]
+

.  Press kbd:[Enter] to execute the import command. Your image should be now displayed on the FomoFoto application as shown in the figure below.
+
.Import Success
image::importSuccess.JPG[width="917"]
+

. Increase the brightness of the image by typing the following command: `brightness 2.0`. This doubles the brightness of the image.

+
.Brightness Command
image::brightnessCommand.JPG[width="915"]
+

.  Press kbd:[Enter]. Your image should be brighter as shown in the figure below.
+
.Brightness Success
image::brightnessSuccess.JPG[width="917"]
+

.  Crop your photo by typing the following command: `crop 310 250 140 200 squirrel.jpg`. Press kbd:[Enter]. Your image should look similar as the figure below.

+
.Crop Success
image::cropSuccess.PNG[width="918"]
+

.  Save your edits by typing command: `save`.

== Features
This section describes all the commands available in FomoFoto and includes examples on how to use them.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `import FILEPATH`, `FILEPATH` is a parameter which can be used as `import desktop/photoalbum/image1`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `brightness [BRIGHTNESS_RATIO]` can be used as `brightness or as `brightness 0.9`.

====

=== Black and White Filter : `bw`

Applies black and white filter on opened image based on an integer threshold value. If threshold value is not specified, the black and white filter will use a preset threshold value of 127. Pixels lighter than the threshold value will become white and pixels darker than the threshold value will become black. +
Format: `bw [THRESHOLD_VALUE]`

Examples:

* `bw` (threshold value preset to 127)
* `bw 130`

=== Brightness: `brightness`

Adjusts the brightness of the opened image based on a double-valued ratio. If the brightness ratio is not specified, a preset ratio value of 1.1 will be used. +
Format: `brightness [BRIGHTNESS_RATIO]`

Examples:

* `brightness` (brightness ratio preset to 1.1)
* `brightness 1.9` (increases brightness)
* `brightness 0.3` (reduces brightness)


=== Contrast: `contrast`

Adjusts the contrast of the opened image based on a double-valued ratio. If the contrast ratio is not specified, a preset ratio value of 1.1 will be used.+
Format: `contrast CONTRAST_RATIO`

Examples:

* `contrast` (contrast ratio preset to 1.1)
* `contrast 1.4` (increases contrast)
* `contrast 0.3` (reduces contrast)


=== Crop an image : `crop`

Crops an image based on given top left hand corner coordinates, width and height of final cropped image wanted. +
Format: `crop X_POINTCOORD Y_POINTCOORD WIDTH HEIGHT`

****
* The point coordinates must be separated by a space each.
****

Example:

* `crop 2 3 500 500`

=== Exit the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

=== Export edited image : `export`

Exports the edited image into the specified filepath +
Format: `export FILEPATH`

== Upcoming Features (in v2.0)

=== Layer

Format: `layer add (layer name)` -> Creates a new layer for the user to work on.

Example:

* `layer add BW-layer` adds a new layer with name BW-layer.

This command is not undo-able and transformations on each layer do not affect other layers.


=== Ruler

Format: `ruler [ON|OFF]` -> Toggles a ruler that surrounds the canvas. This will help you in estimating the number of pixels to move when using `layer position` or resizing objects.
