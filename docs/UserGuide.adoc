== Introduction

FomoFoto is a image processing software suite written in Java. This application is optimised for users who are *familiar with the Command Line Interface (CLI)*, while providing a *Graphical User Interface (GUI)* for easy reference. For those who love the CLI, this is written for you! If you are not familiar, don't worry, we'll take you through and you'll be a pro in no time! Who knows? You might even be editing your pictures faster than your friends who use Photoshop! Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!


== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version 9 or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest FomoFoto.jar here.
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your FomoFoto application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  And you have just started up FomoFoto on your device! You can refer to <<Features>> for details of each command. If you would like a step-by-step walk through of our application, scroll down to the next section: A Walk Through.


== A Walk Through
Let's start on our image editing journey, shall we? In this walk through, we will be learning some simple commands to edit a sample image! Let's get started!

.  Head over to this https://twistedsifter.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/squirrel-photobomb-banff.jpg[`link`] over here to get a suggested sample image to start from. Alternatively, you can choose any image you have in your own device currently.

.  Save the image in any desired folder you like on your device, like your Pictures folder for example. Name your image *squirrel.jpg*.

.  Start FomoFoto by referring to <<Quick Start>>.

.  Open the folder that the image file is stored in. Then, to get the file path of the image:
* In Windows: Hold on to the kbd:[Shift] key and *right click* on your image file. Click the option *Copy path*.
* In Mac: {to be filled in}

.  You can now go back to the FomoFoto application. You would now want to import the image into FomoFoto. In the Command Line, type as follows:
+
.Import Command
image::import.JPG[width="912"]
+
. Then, while keeping your cursor on the command line, paste the file path, by simultaneously pressing kbd:[Ctrl] and kbd:[V] keys.
* In Windows: if you used the above method to copy the filepath, please remove the kbd:["] and kbd:["] signs on the two ends of the filepath.

.  Your final command should look something like this, with a different filepath:
+
.Import with Filepath
image::importCommand.JPG[width="915"]
+

.  Then, you can press kbd:[Enter] to execute the import command. Tadah! Your image is now displayed on the FomoFoto application. Your screen should be similar to this.
+
.Import Success
image::importSuccess.JPG[width="917"]
+

. Now let's move on to other commands, shall we? Now suppose you want to decrease the brightness of the photo slightly, maybe 0.9 of the original brightness. So, you type the following command: `brightness 0.9 squirrel.jpg`.

+
.Brightness Command
image::brightnessCommand.JPG[width="915"]
+

.  Once you press kbd:[Enter], FomoFoto will inform you that the filter has been applied successfully, like the image below:

+
.Brightness Success
image::brightnessSuccess.JPG[width="917"]
+

.  Now, you seem to prefer to just have the cute squirrel instead of the humans behind. So, it makes sense that you want to crop the humans away. You can then make use of the crop command: `crop 310 250 140 200 squirrel.jpg` to crop the humans away. After executing, your application would look something like this:

+
.Crop Success
image::cropSuccess.PNG[width="918"]
+

.  Bye bye humans!

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `import FILEPATH`, `FILEPATH` is a parameter which can be used as `import desktop/photoalbum/image1`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `brightness [BRIGHTNESS_RATIO]` can be used as `brightnees or as `brightness 0.9`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
