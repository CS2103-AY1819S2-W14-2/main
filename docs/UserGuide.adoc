== Introduction

FomoFoto is a image processing software suite written in Java. This application is optimised for users who are *familiar with the Command Line Interface (CLI)*, while providing a *Graphical User Interface (GUI)* for easy reference. The application is optimized for users who prefer text-based instructions.

For new users, jump to <<Quick Start>> for an overview on how to use FomoFoto and view the tools available.


== Quick Start
// tag::QuickStart[]
System Requirements:

* *Windows 10 or newer / OS X 10.8 or newer.*
* *Java 9 or newer.*

Follow the steps below to set up your computer to run FomoFoto:

.  Ensure your system meets the system requirements.
.  Download the latest FomoFoto.jar https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W14-2/main/releases[here].
.  Copy the JAR to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your FomoFoto application.
.  Double-click the JAR to start the application. The Graphical User Interface should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  You have just successfully setup FomoFoto on your device. To see the command available in FomoFoto, refer to <<Features>> for details of each command. A step-by-step walkthrough of FomoFoto is available at the next section: <<A Walk Through>>.

== A Walk Through
Let's start on our image editing journey. In this walk through, we will be demonstrating some simple commands to edit a sample image.

.  Head over to this https://twistedsifter.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/squirrel-photobomb-banff.jpg[`link`] to get a suggested sample image to start from.

.  Save the image in any desired folder you like on your device, like your Pictures folder for example. Name your image *squirrel.jpg*.

.  Start FomoFoto by referring to <<Quick Start>>.

.  Open the folder that the image file is stored in. Then, to get the file path of the image:
* In Windows: Hold on to the kbd:[Shift] key and *right click* on your image file. Click the option *Copy path*.
* In Mac: Go to terminal and navigate to your image file. Type 'pwd' to get the filepath to your image file and copy paste.

.  Go back to the FomoFoto application. Import the image into FomoFoto by typing as follows:
+
.Import Command
image::import.PNG[width="912"]
+
.  Paste the file path by simultaneously pressing kbd:[Ctrl] and kbd:[V] keys.
* In Windows: Remove the kbd:["] and kbd:["] signs at the two ends of the filepath.

.  Ensure your final command looks similar to the figure below (filepath may differ):
+
.Import with Filepath
image::importCommand.PNG[width="915"]
+

.  Press kbd:[Enter] to execute the import command. Your image should be now displayed on the Album tab on the FomoFoto application as shown in the figure below.
+
.Import Success
image::importSuccess.PNG[width="917"]
+

.  Open the imported image in FomoFoto by typing as follows:
+
.Open Command
image::open.PNG[width="917"]
+

.  Press kbd:[Enter] to execute the open command. Your image should be now displayed on the FomoFoto application as shown in the figure below.
+
.Open Success
image::openImage.PNG[width="917"]
+

.  Increase the brightness of the image by typing the following command: `brightness 2.0`. This doubles the brightness of the image.

+
.Brightness Command
image::brightnessCommand.PNG[width="915"]
+

.  Press kbd:[Enter]. Your image should be brighter as shown in the figure below.
+
.Brightness Success
image::brightnessSuccess.PNG[width="917"]
+

.  Crop your photo by typing the following command: `crop 310 250 140 200`. Press kbd:[Enter]. Your image should look similar as the figure below.

+
.Crop Success
image::cropSuccess.PNG[width="918"]
+

// end::AWalkThrough[]

.  Save your edits by typing command: `save`.

== Features
This section describes all the commands available in FomoFoto and includes examples on how to use them.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `import FILEPATH`, `FILEPATH` is a parameter which can be used as `import desktop/photoalbum/image1`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `brightness [BRIGHTNESS_RATIO]` can be used as `brightness or as `brightness 0.9`.

====

// tag::BlackWhiteCommand[]
=== Black and White Filter : `bw`

Applies black and white filter on opened image based on an integer threshold value. If threshold value is not specified, the black and white filter will use a preset threshold value of 127. Pixels lighter than the threshold value will become white and pixels darker than the threshold value will become black. +
Format: `bw [THRESHOLD_VALUE]`

Examples:

* `bw` (threshold value preset to 127)
* `bw 130`
// end::BlackWhiteCommand[]

// tag::BrightnessCommand[]
=== Brightness: `brightness`

Adjusts the brightness of the opened image based on a double-valued ratio. If the brightness ratio is not specified, a preset ratio value of 1.1 will be used. +
Format: `brightness [BRIGHTNESS_RATIO]`

Examples:

* `brightness` (brightness ratio preset to 1.1)
* `brightness 1.9` (increases brightness)
* `brightness 0.3` (reduces brightness)
// end::BrightnessCommand[]

// tag::ClearCommand[]

[NOTE]
Images should be of the following formats: `bmp`, `jpg` , `jpeg`, `png`, `tif`, `tiff` or `gif`. Images with `tif` or `tiff` formats are not rendered on screen due to a bug with Java but edits made will still be applied.
