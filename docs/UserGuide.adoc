== Introduction

FomoFoto is a image processing software suite written in Java. It is designed for those who *prefer to work a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while providing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easy reference. For users who who are looking to edit photos in a quick editor, FomoFoto is the best editor out there. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!


== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version 9 or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest FomoFoto.jar here.
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your FomoFoto application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`import`*`f/desktop/photoalbum/image1` : import image1 picture from filepath desktop/photoalbum/image1
* **`undo`** : undo the editing of the image by one step
* **`export`** : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`*`f/desktop/photoalbum` : Export the edited photo into the specified filepath

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `import f/FILEPATH`, `FILEPATH` is a parameter which can be used as `import f/desktop/photoalbum/image1`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `o/OPERATOR [n/DEGREE]` can be used as `o/Subtract n/20` or as `o/Subtract`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

=== Importing an image : `import`

Input the image to edit from a specified filepath. +
Format: `import f/FILEPATH`

Example:

* `import f/desktop/photoalbum/image123`

=== Export edited image : `export`

Export the edited photo into the specified filepath +
Format: `export f/FILEPATH`

Example:

* `export f/desktop/editedphotoalbum`

=== Undo edit steps : `undo`

Go back to the previous state of the image. +
Format: `undo`

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the image (`rotate`, `crop`, `brightness`, `contrast` and `bw`).
====

Examples:

* `rotate 20 4 5` +
`brightness add` +
`undo` (reverses the `brightness add` command) +

* `contrast subtract` +
`crop 2,3 3,4 4,5 5,6` +
`undo` (reverses the `crop 2,3 3,4 4,5 5,6` command +
`undo` (reverses the `contrast subtract`)


=== Redo edit steps : `redo`

Return to a previously undone state. +
Format: `redo`

[NOTE]
====
Redoable commands: those commands that modify the image (`rotate`, `crop`, `brightness`, `contrast` and `bw`).
====

Examples:

* `rotate 20 4 5` +
`brightness add` +
`undo` (reverses the `brightness add` command) +
`redo` (runs `brightness add` again)

* `contrast subtract` +
`crop 2,3 3,4 4,5 5,6` +
`undo` (reverses the `crop 2,3 3,4 4,5 5,6` command +
`undo` (reverses the `contrast subtract`)
`redo` (runs `contrast subtract` command again) + 
`redo` (runs `crop 2,3 3,4 4,5 5,6` command again)

=== Crop an image : `crop`

Crop a photo based on given coordinates. +
Format: `crop x/POINTCOORD y/POINTCOORD w/POINTCOORD z/POINTCOORD`

****
* The point coordinates must be separated by a comma without any spacing in between
****

Example:

* `crop x/2,3 y/3,4 w/4,5 z/5,6`

=== Rotate an image : `rotate`

Rotates the photo for a given degree provided by the user.  +
Format: `rotate a/ANGLE x/XCOORDINATE y/YCOORDINATE`

Example:

* `rotate a/30 x/23 y/45`

=== Contrast: `contrast`

Adjust the contrast of the photo. +
Format: `contrast o/OPERATOR [n/DEGREE]`

Examples:

* `contrast o/add`

* `contrast o/subtract n/30`

=== Brightness: `brightness`

Adjust the brightness of the photo. +
Format: `brightness o/OPERATOR [n/DEGREE]`

Examples:

* `brightness o/subtract`
* `brightness o/add n/40`

=== Black and White filter : `bw`

Change the photo to black and white. +
Format: `bw`

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`
